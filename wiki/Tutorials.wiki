==Overview==
This tutorial demonstrates some early capabilities of the ROS-Industrial software.  The steps in the tutorial walk you through bringing up and using some simple features of the arm navigation warehouse for an actual robot or a simulated one.  The arm warehouse allows you to plan motion in a simulated environment and then execute it either in simulation or on actual robot hardware.

*WARNING: INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS ARE VERY DANGEROUS AND CAN SERIOUSLY INJURE OR KILL.  THE ROS-INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE  BSD LICENSE (I.E. AS-IS AND WITH NO WARRANTY).  WHEN OPERATING AN  INDUSTRIAL ROBOT UNDER ROS-INDUSTRIAL CONTROL, MAKE CERTAIN THAT NO ONE  IS WITHIN THE ROBOT WORKSPACE AND THE E-STOP IS UNDER OPERATOR CONTROL.*

==Arm Navigation Warehouse==
The arm navigation warehouse is used to demonstrate and test arm motion planning.  For a detailed tutorial on the warehouse see this [http://www.ros.org/wiki/arm_navigation/Tutorials/tools/Warehouse%20Viewer tutorial]
  # Bring up a terminal window
  # Launch the warehouse viewer for the sia10d Motoman robot
    * Simulated robot - {{{roslauch sia10d_mesh_arm_navigation planning_scene_warehouse_viewer_sia10d_mesh.launch}}}
    * Actual robot - {{{roslauch sia10d_mesh_arm_navigation planning_scene_warehouse_viewer_sia10d_mesh_real.launch}}}
  # The launch file will bring up the nodes and GUI required to run the warehouse viewer.  Select the warehouse window (this window may be behind the main rviz window).

  # Play around with the arm warehouse.  Added virtual collision object in the robot workspace and plan trajectories around them.  It is highly recommened that you become familiar with the operation of the arm warehouse before executing motion on an actual robot.
  # Prepare the robot for motion:
    * Ensure that the E-Stop is not pressed
    * The key-switch should be in the "Play" position.
  # Trajectories can be executed on the robot by pressing the "Execute On Robot" button in the planning scene warehouse viewer window.  Make certain that you have viewed the trajectory in the rviz and verified that there aren't any collisions before executing motion on the robot.  *Always have the E-Stop in hand when executing robot motion*
