ROS-Industrial is a BSD-licensed ROS stack that contains libraries, tools and drivers for industrial hardware. The goals of ROS-Industrial are to: 
 * Create a community supported by industrial robotics researchers and professionals 
 * Provide a one-stop location for industry-related ROS applications 
 * Develop robust and reliable software that meets the needs of industrial applications 
 * Combine the relative strengths of ROS with existing industrial technologies (i.e. combining ROS high-level functionality with the low-level reliability and safety of industrial robot controllers). 
 * Create standard interfaces to stimulate “hardware-agnostic” software development (using standardized ROS messages) 
 * Provide an easy path to apply cutting-edge research in industrial applications, using a common ROS architecture 
 * Provide simple, easy-to-use, well-documented APIs
 
Check out a video of our progress so far (VIDEO LINK - TBD).

ROS-Industrial is at pre-1.0-experimental release level.  It currently supports ROS control (arm navigation with collision free path planning) for the Motoman [http://motoman.com/products/robots/models/sia10d.php SIA10D] and [http://motoman.com/products/controllers/default.php DX100] controller.  The software works with actual hardware or a simulated robot in rviz.

We’d like to invite others to use this software and contribute new applications and interfaces, particularly ROS drivers for different industrial robot platforms.  If you are interested in integrating a new platform or otherwise contributing to ROS-Industrial, please send an email to [mailto:swri-ros-pkg-dev@googlegroups.com]
