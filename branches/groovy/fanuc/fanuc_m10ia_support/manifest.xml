  <description brief="ROS Industrial support for the Fanuc M-10iA (and variants)">
    <p>
      This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files 
      for Fanuc M-10iA manipulators. This currently includes the base model
      only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in 
      the <em>FANUC Robot M-10iA Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual</em> 
      version <em>B-82754EN/09</em>. All URDFs / XACROs are based on the 
      default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: 
      no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or 
      other options).
    </p>
    <p>
      Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included 
      in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular 
      robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
    </p>
