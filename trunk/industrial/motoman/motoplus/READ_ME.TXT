The MotoPlus directory contains all headers and source files required to compile the MotoPlus application (which runs on the controller).  Any common file should be located in a ROS package source/header directory and linked to this directory using svn file externals.  The only hard files that should be in this directory are those that are specific to motoplus and cannot be shared with other programs.  These types of files require the MotoPlus standard include, #include "motoPlus.h"
