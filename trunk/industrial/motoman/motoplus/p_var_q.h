Point variable queue

The point variable queue class encapsulates the point variable buffer
used to buffer robot motion points.  The robot controller requires a
point buffer in order to do it's own path interpolation and 
ensure smooth motion between points.  This buffer exists between the
motoplus application and the INFORM motion program.  (An INFORM motion
program is used because it can perform smooth motion through several
points, motoplus cannot).  The following section describes the structure
and function of the point variable queue.

Variables:

Position variables (joint type)
(NOTE: The max number of P variables is limited by the controller)
P000 - PXXX(see QSIZE) units in pulses

Velocity variables (integer type)
When specifying a VJ speed in percentage, the controller calculates the 
time it takes for each motor to travel that its distance (in pulse) at 
specified speed. After it finds the motor that will take the longest time, 
it will adjust down the speed of all the other motors so they will take the 
same time.

I000 - IXXX(see QSIZE) (percent 0.01%-100% -> 1-10000)

Buffer Management
The following variables are used to manage the buffer.  Two variables are used.
The current Motion pointer is the index of the point currently being exectuted as
part of the MOVJ (NOTE: Depending on how the controller performs it's look ahead,
this may not be the point that it is currently executing motion on)  
The current buffer pointer is the last point was populated with a valid joint point.

NOTE: These variables are hard-codes in INFORM.  If their indexes change than the
INFORM program must also be updated.

IXXX(MOTION_POINTER) index of current point being executed in MOVJ
IXXX(BUFFER_POINTER) index of the last populated point.

Given these two variables the following can be determined.

BUFFER_SIZE = BUFFER_POINTER - MOTION_POINTER

POSITION VARIABLE INEXES:
MOTION_POS_INDEX        = MOTION_POINTER % QSIZE
BUFFER_POS_INDEX        = BUFFER_POINTER % QSIZE
NEXT_BUFFER_POS_INDEX   = (BUFFER_POINTER + 1) % QSIZE

MAX_BUFFER_SIZE <= QSIZE - 1 (or less, if desired)

The INFORM program should only execute MOVJ on those points when the
BUFFER_POINTER >=  MOTION_POINTER.
