     <p>
     This package contains configurations, 3D models and launch files 
     for Fanuc LR Mate 200iC manipulators. This currently includes the 
     base model and the 5H variant.
     </p>
     <p>
     Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in 
     the <em>FANUC Robot LR Mate 200iC Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual</em> 
     version <em>B-82584EN/07</em>. All URDFs / XACROs are based on the 
     default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: 
     no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or 
     other options).
     </p>
     <p>
     Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included 
     in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular 
     robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
     </p>
